3. After you add the extension to chrome, Click on the "Enter VR" button in the game.
4. Yipeee! You are in sucessfully in my VR environment and you can now teleport and roam around my space and play the gun shooting game!
5. You will be able to see two hand controllers over there - Right and Left
6. Hold the left controller, mark a position with a line pointer and click anywhere in the space and you will be able to teleport to that position immediately.
7. In the same way, With the right controller, first point out on the gun, grab it and shoot it on the target.
8. If you are able to shoot towards the target sucessfully, your score will get incremented.
